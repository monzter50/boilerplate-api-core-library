## Getting Started

First, fork the repository on GitHub and clone your fork locally.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/[YOUR-USERNAME]/boilerplate-api-core-library.git
cd boilerplate-api-core-library
```

## Development Setup

   yarn install
   ```

2. Build the project:
   ```bash
   yarn build
   ```

3. Run tests:
   ```bash
   yarn test
   ```

## Project Structure

The project is structured as follows:

```
src/
â”œâ”€â”€ client/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ DomFetchProvider.ts
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ index.ts
â”œâ”€â”€ server/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ NodeFetchProvider.ts
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ index.ts
â”œâ”€â”€ core/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ apiCore.ts
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ settings.ts
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ types.ts
â””â”€â”€ index.ts
```

- `client/`: Contains client-side specific code
- `server/`: Contains server-side specific code
- `core/`: Contains shared core functionality

## Making Changes

1. Create a new branch for your feature or bugfix:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

2. Make your changes and commit them:
   ```bash
   git commit -m "Description of your changes"
   ```

3. Push your changes to your fork:
   ```bash
   git push origin feature/your-feature-name
   ```

## Testing

We use Jest for testing. Please ensure that all new features or bug fixes are covered by tests. To run the tests:

```bash
yarn test
```

## Submitting a Pull Request

1. Ensure your code adheres to the existing style.
2. Run the test suite and ensure that all tests pass.
3. Submit a pull request with a clear title and description.

## Code Style

We use TypeScript and follow these general guidelines:

- Use 4 spaces for indentation
- Use single quotes for strings
- Use semicolons at the end of statements
- Follow the existing code style in the project
